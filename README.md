# Webscraping-a-Newspaper-and-Data-Cleaning-Using-Python

This is a short webscraping using Python tutorial

Reading newspaper headlines, especially stories from my home country of ESwatini or Swaziland is something I do on a daily basis.
It helps me keep in touch with what is going in the country and this comes in handy especially for me since I live in the USA. 
In this article, we will scrape newspaper headlines using a few lines of Python code. 
We will also perform data cleaning and formatting the data into a dataframe which is easier to read.
